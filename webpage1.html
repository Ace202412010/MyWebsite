    <h3><font face="verdana">10th Sustainable Development Goal</font></h3>

      <p> The 10th sustainable development goal aims to reduce  inequality within and among countries. Inequality often begins at birth, influenced by factors like parental background and birthplace, which affect access to resources and opportunities. Social and economic disadvantages in early life can limit one's potential. Discrimination based on various factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, disability, and more, perpetuates inequality throughout life and across generations. To break this cycle, early interventions and investments in marginalized children are crucial. Achieving Goal 10 and other SDGs requires prioritizing those who are most disadvantaged.</p>
 
    <p>A just society is built when every voice is heard and every life is valued equally.</p>
